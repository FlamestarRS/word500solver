Input your guesses and the resulting green, yellow, and red permutations into this tool to narrow down potential solutions and consistently solve word500.

This tool currently only supports easy mode. JQXZ are excluded by default and solutions cannot have duplicate letters.

Example Guess: "snack 014"

Type "!" to print a list of all possible solutions.

## Recommended strategy:

### Example Guesses: 
1. "mouch"
2. "wefts"
3. "privy"
4. "blank"

From this point forward, enter ! into the tool after each guess and choose common words.

### Explanation
These four words cover 20 of the 22 available letters (exluding D and G). The inclusion of D and/or G can be determined by the total correct (green and yellow) letters revealed by these four guesses.
- If the sum is 5, D and G are not included. 
- If the sum is 4, D or G is included. 
- If the sum is 3, D and G are both included.
