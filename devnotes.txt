Logical flow of information:

Make a guess, interpret green yellow red permutation in a vacuum
    g	y	r	base case interpretation
    0	0	5	letters are not in solution
    0	1	4	letters cannot be where they are
    0	2	3	letters cannot be where they are
    0	3	2	letters cannot be where they are
    0	4	1	letters cannot be where they are
    0	5	0	letters cannot be where they are, letters are in solution
    1	0	4	letters are where they are, or not in solution
    1	1	3	
    1	2	2	
    1	3	1	
    1	4	0	letters are in solution

Dictate where letters can and cannot be given a base case interpretation.
Create a list of invalid letters for each slot.
Create a list of all 5 letter combinations using valid letters.
Find the intersection of combinations and english words.
Narrow down results using additional guesses to determine the solution.
